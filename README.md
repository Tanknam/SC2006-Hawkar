# SC2006-Hawkar

As part of SC2006 Software Engineering Project, we will be developing **Hawkar** which is a web application designed to bridge the gap between hawkers and consumers. It enables hawkers to showcase their stalls and signature dishes, helping them gain visibility in the digital space. At the same time, consumers can explore hawker centers, discover new food options, and contribute reviews to share their dining experiences.
